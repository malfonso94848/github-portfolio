                This was a collabrative personal project I completed with a small group of developers to Wireframe, Test User Experience, and finally develop what we think a re-design of the Florida Historical Society's website would look like! Although our time was limited, we believe we made a number of improvements but if you want to check it out for yourself, click the links below!

              <p>
                This was a project where I challenged myself to create a functioning e-commerce app with only the usage of JavaScript. With it, you can send items to a cart for purchase, add items on the list to be purchased, and even prodceed to a checkout page with a tallied total price! It's not the prettiest but it gets the job done.

            <!-- Replace the below paragraph with info about yourself -->
            <p>
              There are many things to say but not enough words to express it. I am a very open
              minded individual, not afraid to accept other opinions or handle tasks in new and
               constructive ways. I believe there are always ways to improve myself or to improve
               the overall community through consideration and collaboration.
               Lastly, I strive for creativity, welcoming such forms in problem solving and
               personal lives. After all, to explore these endless possibilities is to find new ways
               forward and to express oneself in fascinating ways otherwise not possible.
               Applying to the ever-evolving technological world now more than ever.
               It was these principles of mine which have led me down my path as a Digital/Web
               Designer ever since High School. When I first stepped into this field, I was
               enraptured by this medium as nothing quite captured the involvement of creativity
               and my interest in the technological world as this career allows. Even triumphing
               over my years of experience within mediums of music, acting, writing and
               physical art of which I too thoroughly love.
               It has since been my goal to not only learn all I can within Digital Design but to use
               the skills and technology available to me to change the lives of others. To use the
               languages of scripting and the path of code in order to help those establish
               connections and create visions for idea's they cannot themselves. To aid others not
               as adept to not only introduce them, but guide them into a new world for the
               growth of businesses, establishment of products, or to simply help create their
               dreams within the ever growing wide web.
               To this day, I continue to strive and hone my skills and abilities within my
               education. Soon, the business world as well for the sake of innovation, exploration,
               and the building of these ever-important connections be that from the everyday
               man or woman to the products and/or features that may change their lives in small
               or big ways.
               Though I still have much to learn, life is about improving ourselves no matter what.
               That's why I won't stop learning even after I've become an Expert Web Designer in
               my field.
